RE-IMAGINE SHERIYANS ROUND 2 WEBSITE 
Our team decided to reimagine Steam a fairly known website with a bad UI.

How to Run after downloading, in the main folder terminal type :-
npm install 
npm run dev


For Example after extracting the code zip, in the terminal type :-

C:\Users\bansa\Downloads\BlackhHats-ReImagine-Round2-main\BlackhHats-ReImagine-Round2-main\STEAM LATEST>npm install

C:\Users\bansa\Downloads\BlackhHats-ReImagine-Round2-main\BlackhHats-ReImagine-Round2-main\STEAM LATEST>npm run dev
